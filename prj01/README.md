# Project 01: Basic parameters in REST

Basic REST API based on Spring's [Serving Web Content with Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/) introductory example.

Once the server is running try:

#### Default
```
localhost:8080/greeting
```

results in "*Hello, World!*"

#### With argument

```
localhost:8080/greeting?name=John%20Smith
```

results in "*Hello, John Smith!*"
